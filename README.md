# Homebrew Migration Tool

Automatic process deployed on Heroku for polling the official Homebrew/homebrew-versions repository for new commits, migrating the formulas to allow them to be used in parallell with `brew switch` and pushing all the changes in tappable form to [HaraldNordgren/homebrew-versions](https://github.com/HaraldNordgren/homebrew-versions).
